# ASL Gesture Recognition

This project demonstrates American Sign Language (ASL) gesture recognition using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The ASL Gesture Recognition project allows real-time detection and classification of ASL gestures using a webcam. It employs OpenCV for hand tracking and image processing, and a pre-trained deep learning model for gesture classification.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection and tracking.
- Classification of ASL gestures (A-Z and common phrases).
- User-friendly interface using Streamlit.
